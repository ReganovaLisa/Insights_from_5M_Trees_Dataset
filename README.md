# A story that Trees tell us 

This repository contains the code for the project hosted [here](https://reganovalisa.github.io/Insights_from_5M_Trees_Dataset/web_page/index.html#). The project visualizes the [5M Trees Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/5m-trees-dataset/data), which provides detailed information about tree species across various U.S. cities.  
 
We explored and implemented several types of visualizations using the **D3.js library**, including:  
- Bar plots  
- Alluvial diagrams  
- Radar charts  
- Ridgeline plots  
- Interactive maps  


We hope that this project may be helpful resource for those new to the **D3.js library**, demonstrating its capabilities and offering examples of different visualization techniques.
